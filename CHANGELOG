(July 2005)

- This is the ill-fated never-to-be-publicly release XML to fuzzer version.

antiparser-2.0-beta:

(August 2005)

- antiparser rewritten from the ground up as a Python API.

antiparser-2.0:

(August 17, 2005)

- Removed half-assed sendTCP/sendUDP methods in lieu of adding an entire
socket interface (apSocket).  Client socket interface is currently 
available through apSocket.

- Added version() method for printing the antiparser version string.

- Added evilftpclient.py (1.0) script, which is a fully functional FTP server 
fuzzer script.  This replaces the lame apexample-FTP.py script.

- Added INSTALL notes.

- Updated docs to reflect new API changes.
