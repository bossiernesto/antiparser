No real installation necessary, just unpack the archive in the directory of
your choice.  If you plan of using the fuzzer/example scripts or running an
antiparser script from a directory other than the install directory, add the 
installation directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Unix/bash example:
export PYTHONPATH=installdirectory
